# Springboard_Capstone_2

<b>The Project:</b> 

Within a university, one of the biggest challenges facing administrators and leadership is meeting student needs. As a business, a university's operations are funded by student tuition dollars, and as customers, students expect something in return for their money: space in the classes they need to earn a degree. 

However, actually providing those seats in a balanced, informed manner requires calculation. An additional challenge comes with knowing that each class behaves independently of other classes (i.e. a 100-level general elective course has markedly different enrollment history than a 400-level seminar for upperclassmen). Semester types, too, embody different patterns (i.e. a pattern of enrollment for a fall semester differs from that for a summer semester). Statistically, this variation presents a challenge, as prediction accuracy suffers when we try to over-generalize by using the same model to predict enrollment for differing kinds of scenarios. In this project, I utilize by-semester enrollment data to build an informed projection of the seats in a sample of class levels.

<b>Approach:</b>

I build a time-series model, step-by-step, explaining the components of an ARIMA model separately to demonstrate how the final, full model is the best approach for approximating seats in a class.
